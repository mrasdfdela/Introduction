# Introduction

Thanks for taking the time to read this! I am an aspiring Web Developer currently enrollede in Springboard's Software Engineering program. It is a 9-month, part time software bootcamp and with [a curriculum](https://bit.ly/3fO0A1U "Software Engineering Career Track") focused on modern frameworks and tools.

Up to this point, I have worked with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, Jasmine, Python, Flask, Jinja, PostgreSQL, and (surprise, surprise) GitHub. My repositories here are mainly the exercises that I have completed as I make my way through the program. I have pinned some repos to demo some of my more involved projects (with Capstones projects coming soon!). Look around and let me know if you have any feedback!
